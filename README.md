## Teensy Interface to the GPS  on xplane 10.31

** WARNING THIS CODE IS AWFUL! **

I take no resonsiblity for killing for your Teensy or kittens 

** WARNING THIS CODE IS AWFUL **


My nemesis on XPlane 10 is using the dials on the GPS to try to enter data. so I've made a hardware interface to the gps1 module.

so far 11 buttons and 2 rotary encoders wired to simulate the 10 buttons and the button on the dual rotary encoder.
(but I ran out of buttons)

I doubt I'll be adding the other 2 (left side) rotaty encoders as I have the saitek pannel with the same controls
but it should be easy to add them.
